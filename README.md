I've recently been interested in procedural terrain algorithims. Since I have also been spending a lot of time in React, I thought I'd combine the two and take a dive into react-three-fiber, a React renderer for three.js    

[React-Terra](https://condescending-allen-105b32.netlify.app) implements the Diamond Square height map algorithm. Diamond-square - also known as the cloud or plasma fractal algorithm - was first introduced by Fournier, Fussell and Carpenter at SIGGRAPH 1982

[Take React-Terra for a spin!](https://condescending-allen-105b32.netlify.app) Adjust the sliders to change seed values. Use the mouse to zoom or rotate the landscape. Randomize to generate a new terrain.
